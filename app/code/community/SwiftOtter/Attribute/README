Module: SwiftOtter_Attribute
Copyright: 2013 (c) SwiftOtter Studios
Description:

This module primarily gives administrators the ability to filter for
what categories an attribute is displayed.

Each attribute has an additional tab (Category Exclusions) that contains
checkboxes to select categories to exclude from showing that attribute.

In addition, it exposes a mechanism to specify what attribute is displayed
on customizable tabs (see Block/Override/...).
